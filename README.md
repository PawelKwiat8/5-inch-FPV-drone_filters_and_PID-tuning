## Description

This repository is a technical documentation of the 5-inch FPV drone tuning process. The methodology and data analysis are primarily based on the educational materials and software from **PID toolbox, created by Brian White**. This repository contains a collection of materials, logs, and configuration dumps that step-by-step document the process of optimizing settings in Betaflight 4.6.

## Tuning Goals

The main goal of this process was to achieve the following results through precise tuning of filters and the PID loop:

*   Improved responsiveness and control precision.
*   Maximum elimination of **propwash**.

## Drone Specifications

*   **Frame:** Mark4 5" (225mm)
*   **Flight Controller (FC):** YSIDO F4 V3S PLUS
*   **ESCs:** YSIDO 45A 4-in-1 (flashed with Bluejay)
*   **Motors:** YSIDO 2205 2300KV
*   **Propellers:** iFlight Nazgul F5 (5140) 3-blade
*   **Battery:** CNHL 4S 1500mAh 100C

## Test Flight Types

Data for analysis was collected using three key methods:
### 1. Basic Wobble Test
This method involves generating continuous, sinusoidal movements in the Roll and Pitch axes using a transmitter script.

It should be used with **Angle Mode** set to the following specific parameters:

</p>


1. Duration: ~30 second 
2. Continuously modulate the throttle to to keep the drone up and down 1-2 mteres

### 2. Verification Flight

1.  Perform a standard, smooth flight in Acro mode, avoiding sharp maneuvers.
2.  After landing, **check the motor temperature**. They should be slightly warm at most.
    *   **Note:** If the motors are hot, do not proceed to the next step. This indicates a problem with insufficient filtering that must be resolved first.

### 3. Full Throttle Flight

1.  Perform **2-3 full punchouts**, keeping the throttle at a high level for a few seconds.
2.  During high-throttle flight, perform a **series of quick, full-stick deflections** in each axis.


## Filtering Optimization Process
### Technical Criteria:
*   Reduction of frequency noise to below **-10dB** on the spectrum analyzer.
*   Gyro delay around **1.5ms**.
  
It should be noted that the above values are indicative. The key is to find a balance, as overly aggressive filtering introduces latency, while insufficient filtering can lead to overheating motors.
### Optimization Process and Latency Analysis
### 1. Basic Wobble Test
The following table presents the chronological progression of changes made and their impact on system latency. The values in each cell are shown in the format **`Gyro / Dterm`** (in milliseconds).

| Step | Change Made | Resulting Log | Roll (Gyro / Dterm ms) | Pitch (Gyro / Dterm ms) | Yaw (Gyro / Dterm ms) |
| :--: | :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 0 | **Default values** | **Log 1** | 1.875 / 1.75 | 1.875 / 1.875 | 2.25 / - |
| 1 | `rpm_filter_weights = 100, 60, 75` | **Log 2** | No data | No data | No data |
| 2 | `rpm_filter_q = 1000`, `notch_q_factor = 300`, `notch_count = 3` | **Log 3** | 1.875 / 1.875 | 1.875 / 1.875 | 2.0 / - |
| 3 | `gyro_filter_multiplier = 2` | **Log 4** | 1.625 / 1.875 | 1.75 / 1.875 | 2.0 / - |
| 4 | `dterm_filter_multiplier = 1.3` | **Log 5** | 1.625 / 1.5 | 1.75 / 1.5 | 1.875 / - |
| 5 | `rpm_filter_weights = 100, 50, 65` | **Log 6** | 1.5 / 1.5 | 1.5 / 1.5 | 1.875 / - |
| 6 | `rpm_filter_weights = 100, 30, 65` | **Log 7** | 1.5 / 1.5 | 1.5 / 1.5 | 1.75 / - |
| 7 | `rpm_filter_weights = 100, 20, 55` | **Log 8** | 1.375 / 1.5 | 1.5 / 1.5 | 1.625 / - |
| 8 | `notch_q_factor = 350` | **Log 9** | 1.25 / 1.375 | 1.5 / 1.5 | 1.5 / - |

#### Summary
*   **The optimization process was stopped at step 8.** Analysis of `log009` showed that the `dterm` noise still exceeded the target level of -10dB.
*   Motor temperature after test flights was acceptable (motors were slightly warm, but not hot), suggesting that the overall filtering is close to optimal but requires further precise adjustment.

### 3. Full Throttle Flight


## PID Optimization Process
### Technical Criteria:
*   Minimize settling time
*   Limit overshoot
*   Keep motor thermal load within safe bounds

### PID Tuning Procedure in Betaflight  
*(based on Brian White - PID Toolbox, Oscar Liang)*  

1. Set FF Gains, D Max, I Gain to 0.  
2. Find D Gains → “PD Balance”.  
3. Set Pitch/Roll same proportions using sliders:  
   • Pitch Roll D  
   • Pitch Roll P | I | FF  
4. Find Master Multiplier gain.  
5. Set I Gain.  
6. Set FF Gain.  
7. Set D Max.

### 2. D Gain
